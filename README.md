# A-B-Testing-Simulation-Web-Conversion-Optimization

In this project, I simulated an A/B test on over 10,000 user sessions to assess the impact of a homepage design change on conversion rates. By analyzing conversion data from two different webpage versions (A and B), I applied statistical tests (T-test and Chi-square) to evaluate the differences in conversion behavior. The results showed that the new design (Group B) achieved a 12% increase in conversions compared to the old design (Group A), with a 95% confidence level.
